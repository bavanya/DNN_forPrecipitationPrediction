# DNN_forPrecipitationPrediction

**Problem** - 
Spatiotemporal forecasting. 

**Applications -** 
1. Traffic and transportation.
2. Climate resilience
3. Neuroscience

**Experimental observation**
I have built models using tensorflow in one notebook and using pytorch in another for the same problem.


**An intriguing point on this topic**

In this implementation, we build predictive model taking the numerical data i.e the features, latitude and longitude as input to obtain the precipitation predictions. 

What if instead, we treat this as a computer vision problem and train the models on the geographical heat maps on each time step. 

Which approach would perform better?
